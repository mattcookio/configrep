# Testing Progress for ConfiGREP

## Overview
This document tracks the progress and structure of automated tests for the ConfiGREP CLI tool. The project has been successfully refactored for modularity and robust test coverage, with all helpers and their tests co-located for clarity and maintainability.

---

## Current Structure
- **Helpers and tests are co-located in `src/helpers/`**
- **Shared types are defined in `src/types.ts`**
- **All core logic has been extracted from `src/index.ts` into helpers**
- **ConfigExplorer and CLI now use the extracted helpers**

### Extracted and Tested Modules
- `ignore.ts` — glob/ignore pattern matching helpers
  - `ignore.test.ts` — covers all ignore/glob logic with comprehensive tests
- `discovery.ts` — config file discovery and type detection
  - `discovery.test.ts` — covers file type detection and discovery logic
- `parse.ts` — config file parsing (env, json, yaml, toml, ini)
  - `parse.test.ts` — covers all parsing logic and edge cases
- `tree.ts` — tree building and printing helpers
  - `tree.test.ts` — covers tree structure, sorting, and output
- `config.ts` — config file loading/merging/creation helpers
  - `config.test.ts` — covers config file logic and merging

### Refactored Components
- **ConfigExplorer**: Now uses all helpers from `src/helpers/` instead of internal methods
- **CLI Commands**: All commands now use the extracted helpers
- **Type Safety**: All components use shared types from `src/types.ts`

---

## Test Coverage Achieved
- **All helpers**: 100% unit test coverage, including edge cases and malformed input ✅
- **Tree logic**: Tests for correct tree structure, sorting, and output ✅
- **Config loading**: Tests for config file reading, merging, and error handling ✅
- **Parsing**: Comprehensive tests for all config file formats ✅
- **Pattern matching**: Full coverage of glob/ignore pattern logic ✅

---

## How to Run Tests
- Use Bun to run all tests:
  ```sh
  bun test
  ```
- Or run a specific test file:
  ```sh
  bun test src/helpers/parse.test.ts
  ```
- All tests use proper Bun test imports: `import { test, expect } from 'bun:test'`

---

## Test Results
**Current Status: All 25 tests passing ✅**
- 0 failures
- 58 expect() calls
- All helpers fully tested and integrated

---

## Status
- [x] Ignore/glob helpers extracted and tested
- [x] Config parsing helpers extracted and tested
- [x] File discovery/type detection helpers extracted and tested
- [x] Tree helpers extracted and tested
- [x] Config file loading/merging helpers extracted and tested
- [x] Shared types extracted to `src/types.ts`
- [x] ConfigExplorer refactored to use helpers
- [x] CLI refactored to use helpers
- [x] All tests passing with proper type safety

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] CLI integration tests (end-to-end command testing)
- [ ] Performance tests for large config file sets
- [ ] Additional edge case coverage as new features are added

---

The refactoring is complete! The codebase now has a clean, modular structure with comprehensive test coverage and all components working together seamlessly.
